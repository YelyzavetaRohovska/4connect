A basic skeleton for use in frontend interviews

### Installed packages:
 - React
 - ESlint
 - Prettier
 - Parcel
 - Tailwind CSS
 - TypeScript

### Getting started:

#### Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

#### Start dev-server:
```sh
npm run start
```

#### Write some code:
This skeleton uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as a build-tool and dev-server. For any Parcel-project, the root file is [`src/index.html`](/src/index.html), which in this case also loads `src/app.tsx` and `src/index.css`
