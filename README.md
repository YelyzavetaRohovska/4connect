A basic skeleton for use in frontend interviews

### Installed packages:
 - React
 - ESlint
 - Prettier
 - Parcel
 - Tailwind CSS
 - TypeScript
 - React Router

### Getting started:

#### 1: Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

#### 2: Start dev-server:
```sh
npm run start
```

#### 3: Write some code:
This skeleton uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as a build-tool and dev-server. For any Parcel-project, the root file is [`src/index.html`](/src/index.html), which in this case also loads [`src/app.tsx`](/src/app.tsx) and [`src/index.css`](/src/index.css)

React router is also set up, but currently with only one route (`/hello`), just to see that everything works.

#### 4: Check it out:
Go to [localhost:1234/hello](http://localhost:1234/hello) for an example of a (slightly) styled hello world :)
